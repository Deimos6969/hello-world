# hello-world
Finally getting into GitHub, albeit a little late. 
//This thing is telling me to write some comments. 
Looks like it's not formatted in any particular way. 
Oh well. It's just a README, right? I'm supposed to write a little about myself, so here goes. 
I am finally getting into GitHub to HOPEfully get a little more practice in actual coding, and maybe this will
bring my confidence up enougn for me to work in the kind of career I want. I do currently have a well paying job, however, 
I have not coded much yet, but I HAVE been told to get ready to start writing in Java. I feel scared about this since I 
never got any real world experience, and since it is in my near future, I HAVE to really get into it now. So, I turned to this.
